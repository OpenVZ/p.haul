p.haul
==============

Process HAULer -- a tool to live-migrate containers and processes

The live-migration idea is quite simple. To live migrate a task
one needs to

* stop it and save its state into image file(s)
* make images available on the remote host
* recreate task on it from the images

This is what p.haul does. It heavily uses CRIU (http://criu.org)
to do state dump and restore. Task's stopped time is decreased
using the CRIU's pre-dump action.
